The DESCRIPTION file:
\packageDescription{DIMM}
\packageIndices{DIMM}
This easy to use package runs the Distributed and Integrated Method of Moments (DIMM) for regression with high dimensional outcomes. The user supplies a model and indicator vector. DIMM divides the data into blocks according to the supplied indicator, analyzes blocks using composite likelihood, and combines results using an optimal generalized method of moments (GMM) equation.
